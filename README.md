# Clustering Acoustic Emission Signals for Analyzing Damage Accumulation in Materials

This research focuses on the clustering analysis of acoustic emission signals collected during the operation of structural materials to identify patterns of material damage accumulation. A detailed description of the methodology is available in the "[Clust_AE.ipynb](https://github.com/yanicen1/Clustering-Acoustic-Emission-Damage-Accumulation/blob/7880ad299e3a38e015c0425f9fb2cdb588340dc4/Clust_AE.ipynb)" file. All the libraries used are listed in the 'requirements.txt' and 'environment.yaml' files for conda.
